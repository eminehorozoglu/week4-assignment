I determined the necessary steps of the project. I created my project by following these steps in order. I also used the Trello website to follow the project steps.

I encountered a few problems while doing this project. The most difficult thing for me was writing data to the SQL table. I solved this problem thanks to the sample website "https://guestbook-3ap1.onrender.com/". It also gave me idea to write message data on my website.
